# Search Modal Enter Key Fix

## Issue
The search modal was allowing users to press Enter to navigate to a search results page (`/search?q=${searchTerm}`) that doesn't exist, resulting in 404 errors.

## Root Cause
The `handleKeyDown` function in `SearchModal.tsx` had logic to handle Enter key presses in two ways:
1. **Selected Result**: Navigate to the selected casino page (✅ Working)
2. **No Selection**: Navigate to search results page (❌ 404 Error)

## Solution
Removed the Enter key navigation to search results while preserving the ability to navigate to individual casino pages when a result is selected.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Modified Enter Key Handler**
```tsx
// Before
} else if (e.key === 'Enter') {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (selectedIndex >= 0 && results[selectedIndex]) {
    handleResultClick(results[selectedIndex]);
  } else if (searchTerm.trim()) {
    // Navigate to search results page
    handleSearchSubmit();
  }
}

// After
} else if (e.key === 'Enter') {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (selectedIndex >= 0 && results[selectedIndex]) {
    handleResultClick(results[selectedIndex]);
  }
  // Removed search results page navigation since it doesn't exist
}
```

#### 2. **Removed Unused Function**
- Deleted `handleSearchSubmit()` function since it's no longer needed
- Cleaned up unused navigation logic

## Current Behavior

### ✅ **What Still Works**
- **Type to Search**: Real-time search suggestions appear as you type
- **Click Results**: Click any result to navigate to casino page
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to select results
- **Enter on Selection**: Press Enter when a result is highlighted to navigate
- **ESC to Close**: Press Escape to close the modal

### ❌ **What's Disabled**
- **Enter on Empty Selection**: Pressing Enter without selecting a result no longer triggers navigation
- **Search Results Page**: No longer attempts to navigate to non-existent search results page

## Benefits
✅ **No More 404s**: Users can't accidentally navigate to broken search results  
✅ **Cleaner UX**: Search modal only navigates to valid casino pages  
✅ **Keyboard-Friendly**: Arrow keys + Enter still work for result selection  
✅ **Search Tracking**: Search analytics continue to work for typed queries
