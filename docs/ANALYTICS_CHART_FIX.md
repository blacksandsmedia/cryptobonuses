# Analytics Chart Dot Clipping Fix

## Issue
The dots (data points) on analytics charts were getting cut off at the edges, particularly for the current day's data point on the right side of the chart.

## Root Cause
The `LineChart` components in Recharts were using insufficient right margin, causing the dots to extend beyond the visible chart area.

## Solution
Updated the `margin` prop on all `LineChart` components to provide adequate spacing:

### Before:
```tsx
margin={{ top: 10, right: 10, left: 0, bottom: 20 }}
```

### After:
```tsx
margin={{ top: 20, right: 30, left: 10, bottom: 20 }}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx`
- **Main Analytics Chart**: Updated margin for daily activity chart
- **Casino Detail Chart**: Updated margin for casino-specific analytics

### 2. `src/components/CasinoAnalytics.tsx`
- **Casino Page Chart**: Added margin prop to prevent dot clipping

## Changes Made

### Margin Adjustments:
- **Top**: Increased from 10px to 20px (more space for dots and hover effects)
- **Right**: Increased from 10px to 30px (prevents right-edge clipping)
- **Left**: Increased from 0px to 10px (consistent left spacing)
- **Bottom**: Maintained 20px (adequate space for axis labels)

## Benefits

✅ **No More Clipping**: All data point dots now display fully  
✅ **Better Hover Experience**: Improved space for tooltip interactions  
✅ **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform margins across all analytics charts  
✅ **Mobile Compatibility**: Charts remain responsive with proper spacing  

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:
1. **Dot Radius**: Standard dots (r: 4-6) fit within chart bounds
2. **Active Dots**: Hover state dots (r: 6-8) don't get clipped
3. **Stroke Width**: Line strokes and dot borders display completely
4. **Responsive Design**: Charts maintain proper spacing across screen sizes
